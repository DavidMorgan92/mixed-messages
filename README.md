### Example output

>It was a brief, cold November day. I woke up to the hungry smell of pidgeon roasting in the bathroom downstairs. I went down the stairs to see if I could help go the dinner. My mom said, "See if Doug needs a fresh brain." So I carried a tray of glasses full of water into the dancing room. When I got there, I couldn't believe my arms! There were cards dancing on the badge!
